    <h1>Identities and Values</h1>

    <div>
      <h5>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h5>

    <div>
      <h5>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h5>

      <p>
        I am a product of my experiences and the experiences of others. Growing
        up as a Filipino, religion is a major part of our identity for a lot of
        us. It highly influenced our values and morals. They say to always have
        God as our focus and to give everything up to Him. They say to look for
        a God-fearing partner. To seek out someone who will have religion and
        family as their core, and although I don’t disagree, I grew up despising
        religion. The way it made me feel guilty for not being what they
        preached I should be. Looking up to those preachers only for them to do
        the opposite. It disgusted me.

      <h5>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h5>
      <p>
        I am a dreamer. I like imagining what my life will be like in the future
        and completely get lost in it. I believe this will help me manifest this
        into existence as it acts as a motivation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h5>
      <p>
        A limitation of mine are my bad habits such as going to sleep really
        late and waking up late. These could affect my learning journey as it
        reduces my rest time at night. If I am trying to get things done at
        night due to my lack of productivity at night, I gotta make up for it at
        night which isn’t ideal. Another limitation is anxiety. I don’t do well
        in group settings full of people I have yet to get to know, and it’s
        scary thinking about starting bootcamp and leaving the comfort of my
        room.

    <div>
      <h5>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
