    <h1>Identities and Values</h1>

    <div>
      <h5>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h5>
      <p>
        I don't know when I made an ethical decision but I do remember quitting
        uni was a hard decision to make. I had to take into consideration not
        just my values but my parent's and my culture's values. It's coomon for
        us to follow the traditional route and finish uni, and since my parents
        didn't attend a university, they wanted me to achieve that. But I had to
        put my interest before theirs but I compromised by still furthering my
        studies through Dev Academy. Since I valued wealth, that played a huge
        part on my decision. I wanted to be financially stable and going through
        the university route was taking too long and it was just make me
        depressed and so I stopped. Another value that helped with my decision
        was time. I wanted more time for myself and my loved ones and for the
        things I want to do, and so I figured it's best to get out of uni and
        think of another way to achieve my goals in life.

      <h5>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h5>

      <p>
        I am a product of my experiences and the experiences of others. Growing
        up as a Filipino, religion is a major part of our identity for a lot of
        us. It highly influenced our values and morals. They say to always have
        God as our focus and to give everything up to Him and although I don’t
        entirely disagree, I grew up despising religion. I hated how it made me
        feel guilty for not being what they preached I should be, only to see
        the same people not following what they're preaching as well. It made me
        ponder on the questions "am I a bad person?", "how do you determine if a
        person is bad?" etc. I hated who I was becoming because of those
        quesions and so I don't value religion as I did when I was younger.

      <h5>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h5>
      <p>
        I am a dreamer. I like imagining what my life will be like in the future
        and completely get lost in it. I believe this will help me manifest this
        into existence as it acts as a motivation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h5>
      <p>
        A limitation of mine are my bad habits such as going to sleep really
        late and waking up late. These could affect my learning journey as it
        reduces my rest time at night. If I am trying to get things done at
        night due to my lack of productivity at night, I gotta make up for it at
        night which isn’t ideal. Another limitation is anxiety. I don’t do well
        in group settings full of people I have yet to get to know, and it’s
        scary thinking about starting bootcamp and leaving the comfort of my
        room.

    <div>
      <h5>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h5>
      <p>
        The only example I can think of right now was when my siblings and I had
        to work together to finish our chores. We hate doing chores so there was
        a lot of resistance and tension especially when on or two of us starts
        playing around isntead. I didn't try any strategy except giving into
        temptations and started playing around as well. Next time I should not
        only just improve my productivity with my studies but with my day to day
        life as well so I can develop better habits even more.
