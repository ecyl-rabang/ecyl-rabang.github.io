    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <div>
      <h5>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h5>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to be financially free so I can live out my life in
        peace somewhere outside the city and suburban life doing whatever I
        want.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h5>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
        <p>
          A strength of mine is my willingness to learn but a limitation would
          have to be getting bored and distracted easily. I like learning, it's
          just that I can't staying doing something for a long time unless if
          I'm really into what I'm doing.
        </p>
      </h5>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h5>
      <p>
        I’d like to be more sociable by the end of my Dev Academy journey. I
        would also love to make new friends and connections. Ever since I
        graduated from high school I stopped being in contact with a lot of
        friends, anxiety had a massive role in that as well, so it'll be nice if
        I can manage to make a friend or two from Dev Academy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives
      </h5>
      <p>
        I'm trying to finish my sprints by Fridays and make some exceptions to
        work some more on Saturdays, so I'm really working on my time management
        and weekday productivity so I can have the weekends as my rest days. I
        have a planner which I have recently started using again to improve
        productivity and I have yet to properly use the timebox suggestions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h5>
      <p>
        I have a friend that previously did Dev Academy so I ask him for help at
        times but because I want to improve my confidence I'm trying to gather
        up the confidence to seek it on discord. This means following the
        timebox suggestions so I'm able to ask for help earlier and not on the
        weekends.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h5>
      <p>
        I expect to recieve help when I ask for help (when they can) and for
        consideration of my personal issue (anxiety). I am new to programming
        and I've never made a website/blog before so everything is overwhelming.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Nope. I have no other commitments, except for my plasma donation which
        I've made sure doesn't affect my productivity.
